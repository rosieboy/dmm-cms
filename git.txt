# View git history
$ git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all

# This is most commonly used because it will create the branch for you from your current branch and it will switch you to that branch in a single command.
$ git checkout -b <branch-name>

# Another common way is by using the branch command directly (which checkout does behind the scenes):
$ git branch <branch-name>

# If you want to work on the branch immediately then you'll need to switch to it manually using the checkout command:
$ git checkout new-branch
Switched to branch 'new-branch'
